> "What is in question here is not only the retention within the choral office of the Latin language, though it is of course right that this should be eagerly guarded and should certainly not be lightly esteemed. For this language is, within the Latin Church, an abundant well-spring of Christian civilisation and a very rich treasure-trove of devotion...The traditions of the elders, your glory throughout long ages, must not be belittled."
> 
> â€” Pope Paul VI, *Sacrificium Laudis*, 1966
